Boost Production in new world x10 and also lower workforce requirements of most factories to 1. 

***Important***: 
You need to have the raw material far away from the factory to force both the raw material and factory to use Warehouse. 

For example place Sugar cane plantation, cocoa Plantation, etc in one side of the island and Rum Distillery, Chocolate Factory, etc on the other side. 

This is happening because raw material farm/field produce x10 but the factory need only 1 to input. 

Although, if the raw material field/farm is in range of the factory it will still try to unload 10 materials in factory and will stuck. 

Just keep your production chain separated so its forced to use warehouse. Chocolate factory uses sugar cane directly instead of sugar, so no need for sugar refinery.
