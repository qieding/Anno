You start with 8 Cargo Ships and 1 Oil Tanker. Cargo Ships have Coffee, Rum, Gold (pocket Watches) and Caoutscouc(Bicycle). 

This is to make the transition from Artisans to Engineers very easy, and use these cargo ships for trading between old/new world.

Also lowered maintenance cost of Oil Tanker and cargo ship to 1, and doubled the speed of cargo ship.
